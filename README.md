I want to create an html game or calculator about steroidogenesis

It is like a calculator style game wherein the display will start with 1 of the 3 substance (Cholesterol, Pregnenolone, Progesterone), with a prompt above that will ask one of the 3 products at random (Aldosterone, Cortisol, Testosterone) example: "Give me Aldosterone"  
The player will then click buttons to navigate and give the game what it asks depending on the pathway he will choose for the cholesterol

and then the buttons I have will be the enzymes related to steroidogenesis.

If I click Cholesterol desmolase this means I want to convert cholesterol into another compound.

The display will now show Pregnenolone

Clicking enzymes that won't do anything to the compound in display will immediately announce "game over" and the player will have to click "try again" and will ask for another product randomly.

If the player finaly displays what the game asks, then it will announce "Good Job!!" and will ask if the player wants to "try again?" and will ask for another product randomly.

If the player produces a final product which was not asked by the game will immediately result in "game over" and the player will have to click "try again" and will ask for another product randomly.

These are the following buttons (enzymes):
cholesterol desmolase
3B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase
21B-hydroxylase
11B-hydroxylase
Aldosterone synthase
17a-hydroxylase
17,20-lyase
No enzyme

For the functions:

Cholesterol desmolase converts cholesterol to pregnenolone

3B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase has 3 functions depending on the display 
If Pregnenolone, this is converted to Progesterone
If 17-Hydroxypregnenolone, this is converted to 17-Hydroxyprogesterone
If Dehydroepiandrosterone, this is converted to Androstenedione

21B-hydroxylase has 2 functions depending on the display
If Progesterone, this is converted to 11-Deoxycorticosterone (DOC)
If 17-Hydroxyprogesterone, this is converted to 11-Deoxycortisol

11B-hydroxylase has 2 functions depending on the display
If 11-Deoxycorticosterone (DOC), this is converted to Corticosterone
If 11-Deoxycortisol, this is converted to Cortisol

Aldosterone synthase converts Corticosterone to Aldosterone

17a-hydroxylase has 2 functions depending on the display
If Pregnenolone, this is converted to 17-Hydroxypregnenolone
If Progesterone, this is converted to 17-Hydroxyprogesterone

17,20-lyase has 2 functions depending on the display
If 17-Hydroxypregnenolone, this is converted to Dehydroepiandrosterone
If 17-Hydroxyprogesterone, this is converted to Androstenedione

No enzyme has 1 function depending on the display
If Androstenedione, this is converted to Testosterone
